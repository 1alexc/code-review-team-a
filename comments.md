## Comments for Team A

**Great Job**

Your team's code was written neatly and the use of comments to section your answers was very helpful!

**Ticket 2d**

You are missing the `console.log` for the `firstChild` and `lastChild` nodes.

**Ticket 2e**

Well done using `console.log(cherry)` to check you had picked the right element from the `itemList`

**After Ticket 2e**

Good job at finding the sibling elements dynamically. Do you understand each line of the code you have used? A simpler way to get these sibling elements would be to use `.querySelector` and `nth-child` to select the Cherry item rather then using an `If` statement. Ask the TutorBot or a coach if you need further explanation.

**Ticket 3f**

Similar to the comments on **After Ticket 2e**, your code completes the question requirements, great work! However, you may want to use `.querySelector` and `nth-child` to target the `Date` content before removing it. Try copying your answer into the TutorBot and asking it to simplify your code using a `querySelector` and `nth-child` approach.
