## Comments for Team A

**Great Job**

Your team's code was written neatly and the use of comments to section your answers was very helpful!

**Ticket 2d**

You are missing the console.log for the firstChild and lastChild nodes

**Ticket 2e**

Well done using `console.log(cherry)` to check you had picked the right element from the `itemList`

**After Ticket 2e**

Good job at finding the sibling elements dynamically. Do you understand each line of the code you have used? A simpler way to get these sibling elements would be to use `.querySelector` and `nth-child` to select the Cherry item rather than an If statement. Ask the TutorBot or a coach if you need further explanation.

**Ticket 3f**

Similar to the comments on **After Ticket 2e**, your code completes the question requirements, good work. However, you may want to use `.querySelector` and `nth-child` to target the Date content before removing it. Try copying your answer into the TutorBot and asking it to simplify your code using a `querySelector` and `nth-child` approach.
